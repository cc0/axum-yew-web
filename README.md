Hi! This is my Bachelor's Project, but you are free to do wharever you want (#MIT License).

(All development was tested only in Linux env, which mean idk if this repo would work under Windows/Mac or other Unix systems)

* for backend I use Rust framework - Axum.
* for frontend I use Rust framework - Yew.
