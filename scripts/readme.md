## Config Files

I listed and described every config file in this folder.

___

#### Nginx.conf

(needs to be located at: /etc/nginx)

This is the nginx config file. I use nginx between frontend and client, so the connection would be HTTPS. Between backend and frontend there's a TLS via pem files.

___

#### Docker-compose.yaml

(can be located anywhere)

I use it to conteinerize project database. It uses PostgreSQL.
